- inventories of permanent and temporary stations
- maps in *.ps, *.pdf and *.png formats
- *.kml files for GoogleEarth
- scripts to create the maps
- auxiliary input files
- figures for the paper about AdriaArray

If you are about to take the maps provided, go to AdA/MAPS/.

If you want to display the stations in GoogleEarth, go to AdA/GOOG/ and take the *.kml files.

In AdA/, there are also three pdf files with documentation:

maps-legend.pdf explains how the AdriaArray network was planned and what can be seen on the maps. It is enough to read this text to understand the maps provided.

maps-manual.pdf talks about the scripts and how to produce the maps from the station inventories. This could be useful when you are about to modify the scripts and produce your own maps.

TechDocNames.pdf describes the station names and network codes used.

Enjoy!
